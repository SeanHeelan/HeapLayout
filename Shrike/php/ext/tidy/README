README FOR ext/tidy by John Coggeshall <john@php.net>


Tidy is an extension based on Libtidy (http://tidy.sf.net/) and allows a PHP developer
to clean, repair, and traverse HTML, XHTML, and XML documents -- including ones with
embedded scripting languages such as PHP or ASP within them using OO constructs.
