This is the unified Sybase-DB style driver for PDO.

This extension register itself as:
	- 'mssql' when built against the Microsoft DBLIB library
	- 'sybase' when built against Sybase ct-lib
	- 'dblib' when built against FreeTDS

The following database products are free for testing:
	- Microsoft SQL Server Express (Windows Only)
	- Sybase Adaptive Server (Windows, Linux, *NIX)
	- Microsoft SQL Server Azure (One Month Trial Cloud Service)

You must set the following environment variables to run the tests:
	- PDO_DBLIB_TEST_DSN  - DSN (e.g., dblib:host=localhost;dbname=test)
	- PDO_DBLIB_TEST_USER - database user
	- PDO_DBLIB_TEST_PASS - database user password

This extension supports multiple versions of the TDS protocol. There are
behavioral differences between versions. When making changes, it's recommended
to test across all supported versions. You can specify a version using a version
parameter in the DSN. See dblib_driver.c:pdo_dblib_handle_factory() for valid
values. Some tests check version-specific behavior by parsing this string, so
it's best to use the DSN (rather than freetds.conf, etc.) to set the version.
