Process Control Module for PHP (pcntl)

This module will attempt to implement all features related to process spawning and
control (fork(), waitpid(), signal(), WIF's, etc). This is extremely experimental, 
with hope to become stable on most UNIX's. I greatly apreciate any feedback, fixes, 
and or suggestions on how to improve/better implement
this functionality.

Thanks,
